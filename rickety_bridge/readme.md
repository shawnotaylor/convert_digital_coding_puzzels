## The Rickety Bridge Problem

Four travellers have to cross a shaky bridge at night. The bridge can only bear the weight of two persons at a given time and a flashlight is needed to cross the bridge. There is only one flashlight available among the group.
Now, no traveler walks with the same speed: it takes 1 minute for the first traveller to cross the bridge, whereas it takes 2, 5 and 10 minutes for second, third and fourth traveller to perform the same task. Moreover, while crossing the bridge in a set of two, the faster traveller has to match the pace of the slower one. Hence, how much time (least amount) will it take for all travellers to cross the bridge?

It will take 17 minutes for the travellers to perform the task. How? Letâ€™s find out.
The first and the second traveller can cross in 2 minutes - 2 minutes
The second traveller comes back in 2 minutes- 4 minutes
Now, the third and fourth cross in 10 minutes -14 minutes
The first comes back -15 minutes
Then, the first and second cross together within 2 minutes, making it a total of 17 minutes.
